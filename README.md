# Haxballers

Our project idea is to develop and train a multi-agent system to play the game of Haxball, a simplified soccer simulation game. The behaviors we want the agents to learn is to score goals, defend against goals, and pass to teammates. Agents will use the current game state as input, including the positions and velocities of all players and the ball, and output a cardinal direction to move in or a kick action.
